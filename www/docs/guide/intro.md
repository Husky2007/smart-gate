# Setup Guide - Introduction

In order to use the Smart Gate system in your environment, you have to deploy your own instance
of the client, server and database and lastly prepare your device.
Next sections will guide you step by step through whole process.

To make it as simple as possible there is already a prepared template for 1-click deploying client(web-app) and api(server) along with database.
You only have to click provided buttons to deploy your own instances and fill up the required environment variables.

Last section describes step by step preparing of physical/electric parts of the project based on Raspberry Pi.
