## üì¶ Packages Docs

Each package have their own documentation in a README file with set of guidelines.

Check below list of packages for details:

- Backend:
  - [Api](./packages/api/README.md)
  - [Device](./packages/device/README.md)
- Frontend:
  - [Client](./packages/client/README.md)
- Utils:
  - [CI scripts](./packages/ci-scipts/README.md)
  - [E2E tests](./packages/e2e/README.md)

## üìè Conventional Commits

Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
Also it requires [package scope](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/config-lerna-scopes).

**Structure:**

```git
type(package-name): general info
```

**Structure with more inforamtion:**

```git
type(package-name): general info

- add login panel
- add avatar
```

**Examples:**

```git
feat(api): add comment section
```

```git
fix(client): flickering header
```

Common types according to commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) can be:
[conventional-commit-types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json).
Header (first line) must not be longer than 100 characters.

For just validating your commit message without commiting it use terminal:

```shell
echo 'foo: bar' | commitlint
```

## ü§ñ Hygen - Code generator

Hygen is the cli dev tool that provides the ability for generating scalable code.
All code generation templates are defined in the `__template` directory.
Remember to add created model to git files (typically those files are excluded from default).

It is completly optional but in long term it is very helpful.

For more details check [Hygen docs](https://www.hygen.io/docs/quick-start/).

### Available generators:
